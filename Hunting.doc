Shooting priority begins at 4

A danger lane is defined as a segment where a pulsar exists and pulsing >E0, or where an enemy is at depth 0x20 or less (but not 0).  Or if a shot is at depth 0x30 or less

When hunting the process begins in lane player_abs_segment and expands outwards one lane at a time.  So if spinner is at 5, it will search 4/6, 3/7, 2/8, 1/9, -/10, -/11, etc
If the current lane is a danger lane, we move to safety with shooting priority 8
else If the current player_abs_segment contains an enemy, we stay and shoot
else If the current segment does not contain an enemy, then we expand the search one step at a time

    - For each segment current-X and current+X for X=0-15, where segment is a valid result (0-15), we look at the left lane and the right lane
    - If we hit a danger lane in our search, we ignore this segment and abandon FURTHER searching in this direction (left or right)
    - When we look one segment left, if target exists, and lane is safe, then we target the left lane with priority 6.  Then same for right
    - If no target but no danger, and current lane is dangerous, we target the safe lane
    - Our search expands outwards from the current segment, looking only at valid segments

When looking for targets in a lane, the priority is pulsar, flipper, tanker, fuseball, spiker, nothing (where nothing is safety lane)

Once a segment to move to is selected, we look at the priority.  If the priority is greater than the current shot count, we flipper

So, if there is danger in the current lane, the spinner seeks the first safe segment it can find in its expanding search.
If it finds a safe lane but no target, it remembers the safe lane
If it finds a safe target, it targets that lane

--- V2 ------

Let's build a map of danger on the Tempest playfield for each segment 0-15.  A value of 1.0 will represent certain death and a value of 0.0 will mean safety.

WE then check threats and populate the table as follows:

- For any enemy or shot, we create a scalar that goes 0-1 for depth, where depth of xF0 is 0.0 and depth of 0x10 is 1.0, and in between is mapped accordingly
- If one of the four enemy shots is in that lane, the danger is 0.8 * depth_scalar
- If an enemy is in the lane, the danger is 0.8 * depth_scalar
- If a fuseball is in the lane and is moving TOWARD the top rail, the danger is 0.9
- If a pulsar is in the lane, the danger is 0.5.  If pulsing above 0xC0 theshold value, then 1.0

First, we establish where the player would LIKE to move to hunt, using the existing hunt logic.
